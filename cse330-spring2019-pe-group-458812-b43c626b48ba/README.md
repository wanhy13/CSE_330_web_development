1.Apache and Nginx comparison on the same AWS instance type:

With IIS approaching in the rear-view mirror like this, 
we thought it made sense to ask the question of which comes out on top: NGINX vs Apache? 
Because they’re both equally close to the pinnacle of the popularity chart as web servers. 
We want to see how they measure up in 6 crucial areas – performance for static versus dynamic content, OS support, security, flexibility, documentation, and support.
Apache’s .
htaccess file gives it an edge for those in need of shared hosting,
while NGINX has the upper hand with dynamic content and more elaborate features. Hence why users of VPS and dedicated hosting sing its praises. 
We’ll consider them feature-by-feature and suggest which one might be better for handling whichever web app project you’ll be attacking next.

2.Node.js and Apache+PHP comparison on the same AWS instance type:
 PHP is a server-side scripting language. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 primarily for web development. 
 Originally PHP stood for Personal Home Page, but now it stands for a recursive acronym – PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.  
 Node.js is an open-source, JavaScript run-time environment used to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. 
 Node.js development process has changed the paradigm that JavaScript is used primarily on the client-side. 
 That’s why Node.js has become one of the foundational elements of the “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm. Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
 t is a good idea to choose a winner in PHP vs Node.js based on the features and benefits.
