Haiyu Wan: 458812
Angelica Harris: 450449

Functionality: 
You can invite people who are in the home to a public room. 

Creative Portion:
1. When user leave the page it will automatically logout and leave the room. So when the next time the user want to login will not have the repeat username problems. The page can check the current user name to make sure that the same user name can’t log in and it can also check the room name repeat.
2. We add invite button. When you are in a chat room. You can send invitation to the user who is currently in the public room(“home”). They can accept your invitation and join the room. You can not send invitation from a private room with password.
